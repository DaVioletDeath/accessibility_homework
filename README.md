Hello this is the readme portion of my project, here i will talk briefly about all of what I did to make this a more accessible, and easier to look at webpage

    I condensed the classes down into smaller, more compact classes because every classes attributes in that subsection was the same and there was no need to have all that code

    I adjusted the margin, font, padding and float properties of the webpage

    I rearranged the footer to be less of a mess and to not be encroached upon by all the other elements of the page

    I decreased the size of the images in my image editor so the webpage could load more quickly than it had before

    I increased the readability of the rows and columns on the page
